/* This code snippet is a simplified version of the printf function in C programming language. Here is an explanation of how the code works:

    The function int _printf(const char *format, ...) takes a format string format and a variable number of arguments (...).
    It initializes a counter char_print to keep track of the number of characters printed.
    It checks if the format string is NULL and returns -1 if it is.
    It then starts processing the format string by iterating through each character in the string.
    If a character is not %, it directly writes the character to the standard output and increments the char_print counter.
    If a % character is encountered, it checks the next character to determine the type of formatting.
    If it's 'c', it extracts a character argument using va_arg and prints it.
    If it's 's', it extracts a string argument, calculates its length, and prints the string.
    If it's '%', it checks if the following character is also '%'. If so, it returns 0, indicating that a single '%' was printed. Otherwise, it simply prints the '%' character.
    If it's 'd' or 'i', it calls a function print_num to print an integer argument and increments char_print.
